# Illegal Sand Mining Detection

Deep learning pipeline for detecting illegal sand mining activities using satellite imagery and change detection.

## Technical Approach
- Temporal change detection using Sentinel-2 imagery
- Spectral indices (NDWI, MNDWI, NDVI) analysis  
- Deep learning segmentation models
- Free, open-source data sources only
